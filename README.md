# 📰 TruStorE™: Sifting Fact From Fiction

NLP classifier for misinformation detection. Powered by TruStorE™: Truth over tone technology, TruStorE™ blends linguistic heuristics, sentiment drift analysis, and Word Pair Logic™ to flag manipulative tone in news articles, a tell-tale sign of fake news as emotions are elicited to replace facts.  Built for reproducibility, modular deployment, and impact.

### ⚙️ How It Works

- **Truth Over Tone Technology™**  
  Flags tonal asymmetry and sentiment drift using a proprietary blend of heuristics and NLP scoring logic.

- **Word Pair Logic™**  
  Extracts linguistic signals from bigram patterns using SME-informed heuristics. Visualized via histogram plots to highlight frequency and semantic asymmetry.

- **Sentiment Analysis**  
  Tests emotional polarity hypotheses. Visualized with histogram distributions and mean score overlays.

- **TrueStorE™ Certification Engine**  
  Final decision logic that certifies article integrity based on cumulative linguistic, tonal, and semantic signals.  
  Think of it as the final stamp—deployable, explainable, and recruiter-facing.

- **Strategic Sampling**  
  Bypasses NLTK constraints by curating datasets that preserve semantic diversity and tone variance.

### 📥 Data Provenance

This classifier was trained and tested on a curated dataset of true and fake news articles.  
The CSVs were going to be included in `/data/` for reproducibility until I realized they exceeded GitHub's upload limit. 
Original source: Provided as part of a Ground.News simulation task.  
No proprietary data used. All preprocessing and labeling logic is visible in the notebook.

### 📦 Dataset Downloads  
Due to GitHub’s upload limit and Google Drive’s preview threshold, both datasets are hosted externally. Download directly below:

- ✅ [True_stories.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T1vAwLXjE_Tm9OYVoi_7JhcuvEGwKNR8/view?usp=sharing)  
- ❌ [Fake_stories.csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1u9kgcCBjSfVLqH8kNIc47iFKcKiqxEPV)

### ✅ Deployment Strategy

- Notebook-first walkthrough is ready for Jupyter download  
- Modular logic blocks are structured for RESTful API deployment  
- Multilingual pipeline supports expansion to non-English datasets  
- Dashboard wiring with recruiter-facing metrics and footer lore is next on deck

### 👣 Next Steps for Real-World Integration:

🧠 Save and version the trained model
🔌 Create an API endpoint for real-time classification
🌐 Integrate with Ground News website backend
📱 Extend functionality into the mobile app interface
🌍 Add multilingual translation tech for global scalability
📊 Leverage balanced F1 harmonics (0.96 sweep) for EVALS benchmarking

This isn’t just a model—it’s the TrueStorE™ Certification Engine, powered by Word Pair Logic™, Sentiment Drift Index™, and Truth Over Tone Technology™.
