# 📰 TruStorE™: Sifting Fact From Fiction

NLP classifier for misinformation detection. Powered by TruStorE™: Truth over tone technology, TruStorE™ blends linguistic heuristics, sentiment drift analysis, and Word Pair Logic™ to flag manipulative tone in news articles, a tell-tale sign of fake news as emotions are elicited to replace facts.  Built for reproducibility, modular deployment, and impact.

### ⚙️ How It Works

- **Manipulative Tactic Detector™**  
  Flags tonal asymmetry and sentiment drift using a proprietary blend of heuristics and NLP scoring logic.

- **Word Pair Logic™**  
  Extracts linguistic signals from bigram patterns using SME-informed heuristics. Visualized via histogram plots to highlight frequency and semantic asymmetry.

- **Sentiment Analysis**  
  Tests emotional polarity hypotheses. Visualized with histogram distributions and mean score overlays.

- **TrueStorE™ Certification Engine**  
  Final decision logic that certifies article integrity based on cumulative linguistic, tonal, and semantic signals.  
  Think of it as the final stamp—deployable, explainable, and recruiter-facing.

- **Strategic Sampling**  
  Bypasses NLTK constraints by curating datasets that preserve semantic diversity and tone variance.

### 📥 Data Provenance

This classifier was trained and tested on a curated dataset of true and fake news articles.  
The CSVs are included in `/data/` for reproducibility.  
Original source: Provided as part of a Ground.News simulation task.  
No proprietary data used. All preprocessing and labeling logic is visible in the notebook.

### ✅ Deployment Strategy

- Notebook-first walkthrough is ready for Jupyter download  
- Modular logic blocks are structured for RESTful API deployment  
- Multilingual pipeline supports expansion to non-English datasets  
- Dashboard wiring with recruiter-facing metrics and footer lore is next on deck  

---

### 👣 Next Steps

- Package `tone_detector.py`, `word_pair_logic.py`, and `certification_engine.py` as deployable microservices  
- Expand classifier to include image-caption consistency checks  
- Add drift detection for real-time news monitoring  
- Wire up dashboard with recruiter-facing metrics and footer lore
